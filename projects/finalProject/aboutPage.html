    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Tongi Snacks is a family-run baking business inspired by the flavors of the Pacific Islands and Mexico. We bring a unique blend of cultures into every bite, combining tradition with creativity.</p>
    <p>We started off in Idaho where we had the name Tongi Snacks but instead of baking we made gift baskets upon request.</p>

    <h3>Why We Bake</h3>
    <p>My wife started baking as a way to bring comfort and joy to our home, and soon friends and family wanted to order her treats. From tres leches to churro bites, every snack is made with love.</p>
