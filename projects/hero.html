        <h3>Rodney Tongi</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to my hero in life only one name comes to mind, Rodney Tongi.
        My dad pushed me to be the best I could be in everything I did.  I couldn't appreciate what he did for 
        me until now. He would take me out to the beach every weekend to train and run. All the success I had, I 
        owe it to my father. You may ask why choose my father as my hero? It is because he is the only person I 
        want to be exactly like him.
