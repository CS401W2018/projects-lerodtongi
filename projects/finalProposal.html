            <li><strong>Tongi Snacks</strong> This is my wifes baking company that she bakes for weddings and other such events. </li>
            <li>We started this company to help pay for my schooling and it has blown up in popularity.  We have been able to have pop ups at alot of events here in the community of Laie. This website would be to help get business for personal events and to give people a way to contact my wife and view the menu options.</li>
            <li>On the home page I would have a brief backstory about the bakery and how it caters to my wifes mexican ethnicity. </li>
            <li>I would love to make a table that has calorie information and ingredients.</li>
            <li>I would gather information by taking pictures of her in action and taking pictures of the items on the menu.  I will also search websites for information on Mexican culture and nutrition facts. The references I will be using are nutrition.gov and health.hawaii.gov</li>
            <li>I, Lerod Tongi, have read and agree to the warning listed on canvas.</li>
