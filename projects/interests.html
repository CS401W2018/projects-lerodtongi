        <h3>Anime</h3>
    <p>One of my biggest interests is anime. Anime is a type of animation that originates in Japan.
        I started watching anime just as a past time after high school. What I love about anime is that its like 
        a way to get out of our own world. I feel that especially as adults, our imagination begins to dwindle.
        Anime reignited my imagination but also motivated me to do more with my life.

    <h3>Sports</h3>
    <p>If you ask my wife she will tell you I spend to much time on sports then with my own family. She's just exaggerating. 
        Growing up in my family, sports was everything. If you wanted to do sports you play to be the best.  I played five sports in 
        High School but my favorite was football. It was great being part of State Championship team. Working together towards one goal.
