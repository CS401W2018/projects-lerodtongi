    <h3>About Me &amp; My Family:</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello to whomever may be reading this and trying to learn of the life of Lerod Tongi.  I was born and raised in Kahuku, Hawaii on February 23rd, 1998.  I graduated from Kahuku High School in 2016. After high school, I went on to serve a full time LDS mission for two years.  I spent those two years learning the portuguese language and teaching the people of Brazil.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment I am currently married and sealed in the temple with my amazing wife and two amazing kids. I met my wife after my mission and got married within that year. We have two kids named <em>Elias Tongi</em> and <em>Rodney Tongi</em>. I am very grateful to be a father and try to do my best to guide them in the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
