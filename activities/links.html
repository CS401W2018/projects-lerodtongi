        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <h4>Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference between these two types of link are that absolute is for links that lead to outer sources that are not in the domain.
            relative links are for links within the domain. Relative links are shorter and more flexible for navigating a website.
        </p>
        <h4>List the 3 rules with relative links.</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Same Folder</li>
            <p>Just change the file name.</p>
            <li>Different Root</li>
            <p>begins with ../</p>
            <li>Start at Root</li>
            <p>Start over</p>
        </ol>
        <h4>Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?</h4>
        <p>They don't always have to be in a NAV tag. Links outside of NAV tags serve a different purpose other than navigation.</p>
